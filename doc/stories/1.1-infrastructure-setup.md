# Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup

## Status
**PENDING** 🔄

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the core technical infrastructure with Next.js 14, PostgreSQL via Supabase, and TypeScript,
**so that** I have a scalable, type-safe foundation for the LifeGrow self-improvement platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14+ project initialized with App Router structure and proper folder organization (/app, /components, /lib, /services)
2. Supabase project created with PostgreSQL database configured and connection established
3. Drizzle ORM integrated with database schema files and migration structure
4. TypeScript 5.x configured with strict mode and path aliases
5. Environment setup with .env.example template and proper secret management
6. Git repository established with .gitignore and initial commit
7. Vercel deployment pipeline configured for automatic deployments

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Next.js 14 Project Setup (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Initialize Next.js 14+ project with App Router
  - [ ] Set up folder organization following source tree from backend.md
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
  - [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS 3.x
  - [ ] Install UI dependencies (shadcn/ui, Lucide icons)
- [ ] Supabase & Database Setup (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create Supabase project in dashboard
  - [ ] Install Supabase SDK (@supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/ssr)
  - [ ] Install Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL driver
  - [ ] Create lib/supabase/ with client.ts and server.ts
  - [ ] Initialize Drizzle config (drizzle.config.ts)
  - [ ] Set up database connection in lib/db/
- [ ] Environment Configuration (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create .env.example with required keys (DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, etc.)
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for development
  - [ ] Document environment setup in README.md
- [ ] Version Control Setup (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Initialize Git repository
  - [ ] Create comprehensive .gitignore (node_modules, .env*, .next)
  - [ ] Make initial commit with project structure
  - [ ] Create GitHub repository (optional)
- [ ] Deployment Pipeline (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
  - [ ] Configure automatic deployments from main branch
  - [ ] Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
  - [ ] Test deployment with hello world page

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the foundation story.

### Data Models
**Initial Database Schema** [Source: database.md]:
- **profiles table**: User profiles with preferences, gamification data (total_points, current_level)
- Tables to be created in subsequent stories: habits, transactions, weight_logs, daily_checkins, etc.

### Tech Stack Specifications
**Core Technologies** [Source: backend.md, frontend.md]:
- **Next.js**: 14+ with App Router for SSR/RSC
- **React**: 18.2+ with Server Components
- **TypeScript**: 5.x for type safety
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service (Auth, Database, Storage)
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries
- **PostgreSQL**: 15+ primary database
- **Tailwind CSS**: 3.4+ utility-first CSS
- **Zustand**: 4.x for client state management

### File Locations
**Project Structure** [Source: backend.md]:
- **Root**: package.json, next.config.js, tsconfig.json, drizzle.config.ts, .env.example
- **App Router**: src/app/ with layout.tsx, page.tsx, (auth)/, (dashboard)/
- **Components**: src/components/ with ui/, shared/
- **Backend**: src/lib/supabase/, src/lib/db/
- **Services**: src/services/ (to be implemented in later stories)
- **Types**: src/types/ with database.types.ts

### Infrastructure Requirements
**Deployment Configuration** [Source: architecture.md]:
- **Platform**: Vercel with Edge Network
- **Environments**: Development (local), Preview (PR-based), Production (main branch)
- **CI/CD**: Automatic deployment from main, preview deployments for PRs
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: backend.md]:
- Unit tests target: 80% for services (to be implemented later)
- Testing tools: Vitest for unit/integration tests
- E2E testing: Playwright for critical flows (to be implemented later)

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals targets (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms)
- **Security**: Environment variables must never be committed
- **Scalability**: Supabase provides auto-scaling database
- **Type Safety**: All database queries must be type-safe via Drizzle ORM

## Testing
- [ ] Verify Next.js dev server runs successfully
- [ ] Verify Supabase connection with test query
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation with no errors
- [ ] Verify Vercel deployment completes successfully
- [ ] Verify environment variables load correctly
